# VLSI-Design
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to the trend of integrating cir- cuits into silicon chips. The goal is to design the VLSI of the circuits defining their electrical device: given a fixed-width plate and a list of rectangular circuits, decide how to place them on the plate so that the length of the final device is minimized
